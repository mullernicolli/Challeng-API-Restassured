# Challenge-API-Restassured

This is my first attempet at coding a test of a Rest API using RestAssured, I've never coded in Java and about 5 days ago I had no idea about all this.
It's not perfect and it's basic but I'm too glad to going throught my uncertainties and fear and make this real.

Made with a lot of effort for a technical challenge ðŸ–¤
